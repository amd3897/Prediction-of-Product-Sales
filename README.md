# Prediction-of-Product-Sales
Sales prediction for food items sold at various stores

## A brief describtion of the project.
### The aim of this project is to forecast the sales of food items at different store.
### In the following graph, one can see that people do not really care about fat content in food items, since the average sales of low fat, and regular fat products are nearly the same.
